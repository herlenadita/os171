### ANSWER EXPLANATION
# What happen when system run command /etc/init.d/sudo start ?
#
# from : unix.stackexchange.com/questions/154405/how-does-the-script-etc-init-d-sudo-work
#
# /etc/init.d/sudo  is script that provides limited super user privileges to spesific users.
# the init file(/etc/init.d) itselfs  runs at system boot (or on demand) and do two main things :
# 1. Start running daemons
# 2. Do various one-time-per-boot-tasks, such as  cleaning up or preparing files
#   setting network parameters, etc.
# 
# In this case, the sudo init script does not start a daemon. Instead, it invalidates any cached
# credential files that may have been left around when the system  last shutdown. It does this by using 
# touch to set their modification time to a very long time ago (0, which is Jan 1, 1970).
