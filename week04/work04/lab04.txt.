1.Pointer

a. What are the difference about the code and the output 
from both program ?
Address number of global variable greater than address number of local 
variable.
	
b.Why global variable address number and local variable address number 
have great difference in their address?

Global variables are called such because they are available to all functions within a program.  They
come into being (space is allocated to them) when the program is loaded from disk and they are
destroyed when (space is freed) when the program terminates.

Local variables are declared within a function and are not visible to 
other functions. Local variables are assigned memory space 
when the function is called.  This space is freed-up when 
the function terminates.

Because of those consequences, global variables have greater 
data segments than local variable.

c. Write your knowledge about global variable address 
and local variable address.

Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a program, 
so variables that do not change are generally global in scope. A program 
that relies on a value of pi, for example, might use a global variable. 
They are often placed at the beginning of a program where they are 
easy to access, and constant global variables are often 
spelled with all capital letters.

Local variables, on the other hand, are typically used in a single 
function or method. This allows programmers to reuse variable names. 
The variable "i" is often used for iteration, and making it 
local allows it to be used whenever necessary.

2.I/O Process

source : csapp.cs.cmu.edu/2e/ch10-preview.pdf
a. Explain the paramater of flags in open function that used in the code!
The flags argument indicates how the process intends to access the file:
•O_RDONLY: Reading only
•O_WRONLY: Writing only
•O_RDWR: Reading and writing

The flags argument can also be or’d with one or more bit masks that 
provide additional instructions for writing:
•O_CREAT: If the file doesn’t exist, then create atruncated 
(empty) version of it.
•O_TRUNC: If the file already exists, then truncate it.
•O_APPEND: Before each write operation, set the file position to
the end of the file.

fd = open (file1, O_CREAT | O_RDWR, S_IRWXU);--->the  following  code  
fragment  creates  a  new  file  in  which can be  read  and  written.

fd = open (file2, O_CREAT | O_RDWR, S_IRWXU|S_IRGRP|S_IWGRP|S_IROTH)
the  following  code fragment  creates  a  new  file  in 
 which can be  read  and  written,and file owner has read, 
write and excute permissions. Then group has read permission.
So, it will generate "-rwxr--r--".


b. Explain the parameter of modes in open function that used in the code!
The mode argument specifies the access permission bits of new files.

fd = open (file1, O_CREAT | O_RDWR, S_IRWXU);--->file owner has read, write and excute permissions. So, it will
generate "rwx------".

fd = open (file2, O_CREAT | O_RDWR, S_IRWXU|S_IRGRP|S_IWGRP|S_IROTH)---> file owner 
has read, write and excute permissions. 
Then group has read permission.
So, it will generate "-rwxr--r--".


c. Write your knowledge about open and close I/O process (don't forget
to add the sources if you use reference)
Input/output
(I/O) is the process of copying data between main memory and external 
devices such as disk drives, terminals, and networks. An input 
operation copies data from an I/O device to main memory, and an
output operation copies data from memory to a device.

=======================================================================

3. Write your knowledge about write program:
fd is variable that declare the file name, str1 is the character array 
or string that is used to place the data, strlen(str1) 
call the function that the number of bytes equal to the length of the
 string in that need to be copied .
